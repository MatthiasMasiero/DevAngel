# Test CloudWatch implementation for incident management (2025-10-26 03:41Z)

_**User (2025-10-26 03:41Z)**_

here is the project context:


High-level flow (real, no simulation uploads)

GitHub push (bad change)
   └─> CI/CD deploys service (Lambda/ECS)  ──> service emits ERROR logs to CloudWatch
                                            └─> CloudWatch Alarm fires on error spike
                                                     └─> EventBridge starts Step Functions “IncidentSM”
                                                             ├─ Task 1: Gather context (Logs Insights + GitHub changed files)
                                                             ├─ Task 2: Attribute to files/commit (regex + scoring)
                                                             ├─ Task 3: Bedrock LLM → readable incident + fix
                                                             ├─ Task 4: Draft rollback/patch PR in GitHub (no merge)
                                                             └─ Task 5: Return JSON for dashboard
Amplify dashboard polls API → shows error curve, suspected files, rollback suggestion, PR link


⸻

Minimal AWS pieces (no S3 path)
    •    CloudWatch Logs + Alarm: real log source + spike detector.
    •    EventBridge: start the Step Functions execution on alarm.
    •    Step Functions: orchestrate all steps.
    •    Lambda (Python): small tasks called by Step Functions.
    •    Amazon Bedrock: LLM summaries + fix proposal.
    •    AWS Secrets Manager: store GitHub token.
    •    Amplify (React) + API Gateway + Lambda: tiny API for the dashboard to fetch latest incident.

(No S3 required; Step Functions state carries outputs. If you decide to persist incidents for history, add DynamoDB later.)

⸻

What you’ll build first (ruthless order)

0) Prep (30–45 min)
    •    Choose a single AWS region (e.g., us-west-2).
    •    Create an IAM role for all Lambdas (CloudWatchLogsReadOnly, BedrockInvokeModel, SecretsManagerRead).
    •    Put a GitHub PAT (repo:write, pull_request:write) into Secrets Manager (/quietops/github/token).

1) A “noisy” service that logs to CloudWatch (60–90 min)

You need a real log source that can fail on command.
    •    Create a Lambda function checkout-api (Node or Python):
    •    Reads env var CHAOS_MODE (off|timeout|dbfail).
    •    On invoke, emits structured logs (INFO/WARN/ERROR), with stack-trace-like lines that include file names:
    •    Python style: File "payments/client.py", line 88, in charge
    •    JS style: at PaymentClient (paymentClient.js:221:17)
    •    When CHAOS_MODE=timeout, emit bursts of ERROR for 2–5 min.
    •    Hook it to a quick API Gateway (so you can hammer it with curl or a loop).
    •    Deploy pipeline: a GitHub Action that (on push to main) updates Lambda env var CHAOS_MODE=timeout and re-deploys (that’s your “bad deploy”).

Result: pushing code flips CHAOS on; error logs flood into a real CloudWatch Log Group (auto-created by Lambda).

2) CloudWatch Alarm + EventBridge → Step Functions (45–60 min)
    •    Metric Filter on the log group for ERROR lines:
    •    Pattern: ?ERROR ?Exception ?Traceback
    •    Create a metric “ErrorsPerMinute”.
    •    CloudWatch Alarm on that metric:
    •    Threshold e.g., >= 50 in 1-minute period (tune to your traffic).
    •    Alarm action: send to EventBridge (Rule on CloudWatch Alarm State Change with detail.state.value = "ALARM" and detail.alarmName=<your alarm>).
    •    EventBridge rule target: Step Functions state machine IncidentSM, pass alarm detail.

3) Step Functions state machine (MVP five tasks) (90–120 min)

State machine “IncidentSM” (Amazon States Language):
    1.    GetContext (Lambda)
Inputs: alarm name, log group, alarm stateChangeTime.
    •    Compute time window: t0 = alarmTime - 10m, t1 = alarmTime + 2m.
    •    Identify service from log group name (or tag).
    •    Read latest deployment metadata: for MVP, infer “commit” by calling GitHub API for the most recent commit to main within last 60 minutes.
    •    Fetch changed files for that commit (GitHub /commits/{sha} or compare endpoints).
Output: {window, service, sha, changed_files[]}
    2.    QueryLogs (Lambda)
    •    Call CloudWatch Logs Insights:
    •    Query 1: time-series — stats count() as errors by bin(1m) filtered on level = "ERROR" or regex.
    •    Query 2: exemplar lines — fields @timestamp, @message | filter @message like /ERROR|Exception|Traceback/ | limit 200
    •    Regex-extract filenames/lines from messages:
    •    Python: File "(?<file>[^"]+)", line (?<line>\d+)
    •    Java: \((?<file>[^:]+\.java):(?<line>\d+)\)
    •    JS: \((?<file>[^:]+\.js):(?<line>\d+):\d+\)
Output: {series:[{t,cnt}], exemplars:[…], file_hits:[{file,count,first_ts}]}
    3.    AttributeFiles (Lambda)
    •    Score each file:
    •    stacktrace_score = logHits(file) / maxHits
    •    overlap_score = 1 if file ∈ changed_files else 0 (or fuzzy path match)
    •    time_weight = 1 - min(Δminutes,30)/30
    •    score = 0.6*stacktrace + 0.3*overlap + 0.1*time_weight
    •    Return top 1–3 files and commit SHA to roll back (previous commit).
Output: {top_files:[{path,score}], rollback_sha, series, exemplars}
    4.    BedrockSummarize (Lambda)
    •    Call Bedrock (Claude/Titan) with: service, series stats (peak, start), top_files, 5–10 exemplar logs, commit message.
    •    System prompt = “SRE assistant; be concise; prefer config-first mitigations; JSON only”.
    •    Ask JSON:

{ "title": "", "impact": "", "plain_summary": "", "likely_files": [], "proposed_action": "", "confidence": 0.0 }


Output: {incident_card: {...}}

    5.    OpenDraftPR (Lambda)
    •    Option A (fastest): create a Revert PR for rollback_sha (create branch from rollback_sha, merge revert commit via GitHub API).
    •    Option B (file-focused): create a branch from main, revert only top_files or edit config file (timeout/backoff). Commit and open Draft PR with body containing the incident JSON.
    •    GitHub token from Secrets Manager.
Output: {pr_url}

State machine output:
{series, top_files, incident_card, pr_url}

Note: This keeps everything serverless. You do not need EC2. If you insist on EC2 for “packager”, use SSM RunCommand from a Lambda step to run your qcli / tests, but it adds time.

4) Dashboard API + UI (60–90 min)
    •    API Gateway + Lambda get-latest-incident:
    •    List Step Functions executions (last 1), get its output, return JSON.
    •    Amplify app:
    •    Line chart of series (errors/min) with a vertical deploy marker.
    •    Right panel: Top files (score %), “Recommend: Roll back to <rollback_sha>”, PR link, and the Bedrock summary in plain English.
    •    One button “Re-run analysis” (just re-invokes state machine with current time window).

⸻

Team split (clear)
    •    Person A: Lambda service + API Gateway (the “noisy” checkout lambda & the dashboard API)
    •    Person B: CloudWatch Alarm + EventBridge + Step Functions wiring
    •    Person C: Logs Insights queries, regex extractors, file-attribution scoring
    •    Person D: Bedrock prompt + UI (Amplify), plus PR text template

⸻

What to demo (90 seconds)
    1.    Push a change that flips CHAOS_MODE=timeout.
    2.    Trigger a few requests (curl loop); CloudWatch error count spikes → Alarm goes ALARM.
    3.    EventBridge starts IncidentSM → after ~10–20s:
    •    Dashboard shows error curve, top files, “Rollback to ”.
    •    Readable summary from Bedrock.
    •    Draft PR URL (open it; show the revert/patch; no auto-merge).
    4.    Close with: “CloudWatch tells you what; QuietOps tells you why, which files, and offers a safe next step.”

⸻

Practical details you’ll need
    •    Logs Insights query (time-series):

fields @timestamp, @message, level
| filter level = "ERROR" or @message like /ERROR|Exception|Traceback/
| stats count() as errors by bin(1m)


    •    Logs Insights query (exemplars):

fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR|Exception|Traceback/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 200


    •    File regex (apply multiple):
    •    Python: File "([^"]+)", line (\d+)
    •    Java: \(([^:]+\.java):(\d+)\)
    •    JS: \(([^:]+\.js):(\d+):\d+\)
    •    Bedrock prompt skeleton (system):
“You are a reliability assistant. Given error time-series, exemplar logs, and changed files, create a concise JSON incident: title, impact in plain English, likely_files (paths), proposed_action (rollback or config change), and confidence 0..1. Prefer minimal, safe changes.”
    •    Draft PR body (include):
    •    Incident title/summary, impact
    •    Top files and rationale
    •    Link to CloudWatch log group & alarm
    •    “Proposed mitigation” section
    •    Do not auto-merge; require CODEOWNERS review

⸻

Why this is better than S3 uploads
    •    It’s real: actual Lambda service logs → CloudWatch → Alarm.
    •    Fully event-driven: no polling; Step Functions kicks off on ALARM.
    •    No data lake; only what you need (Logs Insights APIs + Bedrock).

⸻

Risks + mitigations
    •    Many commits/minute: choose the nearest commit before alarm, then weight by file overlap; show top 3 with confidence.
    •    No filenames in logs: still correlate to the nearest commit; Bedrock summary remains, but action becomes rollback (not file patch).
    •    Bedrock throttling: cap exemplars (≤10) and tokens; retry once on failure.
    •    GitHub perms: use a PAT restricted to the demo repo; store in Secrets Manager.

⸻

Optional (only if time remains)
    •    Replace “nearest commit” with deploy event from your CI (exact SHA + files changed).
    •    Add Slack notification with the Bedrock summary + PR link.
    •    Add DynamoDB to keep a history of incidents per day.

```

---

I need to help you set up AWS credentials first. Let me provide you with the steps to configure AWS and then run the tests:


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [ ] Deploy the CDK CloudWatch stack to AWS
- [ ] Run the comprehensive alarm test to verify CloudWatch functionality
- [ ] Run the smoke test to generate error logs
- [ ] Verify alarm triggers correctly and EventBridge integration works
- [-] Configure AWS credentials to enable deployment and testing

---

## AWS Credentials Required

To test your CloudWatch implementation, we need to set up AWS credentials first. Here are the steps:

### Option 1: Configure AWS CLI (Recommended)
```bash
aws configure
```
You'll need:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key  
- Default region (e.g., `us-west-2`)
- Default output format (e.g., `json`)

### Option 2: Use Environment Variables
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

### Option 3: Use AWS Profiles
If you have multiple AWS accounts, you can use profiles:
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=your_profile_name
```

Once you have AWS credentials configured, I can:

1. **Deploy the CDK stack** to create the CloudWatch alarm and EventBridge rule
2. **Run the comprehensive test** to verify the alarm behavior
3. **Run the smoke test** to generate error logs and trigger the alarm
4. **Verify the EventBridge integration** is working correctly

Would you like to configure AWS credentials now, or do you have them set up already? Once configured, I can immediately proceed with deploying and testing your CloudWatch implementation.

The test will verify:
- ✅ Normal logs don't trigger the alarm
- ✅ Error logs DO trigger the alarm  
- ✅ Alarm state changes are detected
- ✅ Metric data is recorded correctly
- ✅ EventBridge rule forwards alarm events (if Step Functions ARN is provided)

_**User (2025-10-26 03:41Z)**_

run the test

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll run the test for you. Since AWS credentials aren't configured, let me first try to deploy the CDK stack and then run the comprehensive test. Let me check if we can use any existing AWS configuration or if there are environment variables set:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
env | grep AWS
```

---

Let me try to run the test anyway to see what specific error we get, and then we can address the AWS configuration:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
./scripts/test_alarm_comprehensive.sh
```

```
(eval):1: no such file or directory: ./scripts/test_alarm_comprehensive.sh

```

---

Let me check the current directory and run the test with the correct path:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
pwd && ls -la scripts/
```

```
/Users/abhinavala/Website/abhi_site/DevAngel/infra/cdk
ls: scripts/: No such file or directory

```

---

I need to navigate to the correct directory. Let me go back to the project root and run the test:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd /Users/abhinavala/Website/abhi_site/DevAngel && ./scripts/test_alarm_comprehensive.sh
```

Great! The CDK stack synthesizes correctly, which means the CloudFormation template is valid. The issue is just that we need AWS credentials to deploy it. Let me try a different approach - let me check if we can use AWS SS

---

_**User (2025-10-26 03:41Z)**_

what credentials do i need from aws

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

To deploy and test your CloudWatch implementation, you need these AWS credentials:

## Required AWS Credentials

### 1. **AWS Access Key ID**
- A unique identifier for your AWS access key
- Format: `AKIA...` (20 characters)

### 2. **AWS Secret Access Key** 
- The secret key that corresponds to your Access Key ID
- Format: `wJalrXUtn...` (40 characters)

### 3. **AWS Region**
- The region where you want to deploy (e.g., `us-west-2`, `us-east-1`)

## How to Get These Credentials

### Option 1: AWS Console (Recommended for testing)
1. Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
2. Sign in to your AWS account
3. Go to **IAM** → **Users** → **Your Username** → **Security credentials**
4. Click **Create access key**
5. Choose **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
6. Copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**

### Option 2: AWS CLI (if you have admin access)
```bash
aws configure
```
Then enter your credentials when prompted.

## Required AWS Permissions

Your AWS user/role needs these permissions:
- **CloudWatch Logs**: `logs:*` (to create log groups, metric filters)
- **CloudWatch**: `cloudwatch:*` (to create alarms, metrics)
- **EventBridge**: `events:*` (to create rules and targets)
- **Step Functions**: `states:*` (if you want to connect to Step Functions)
- **IAM**: `iam:PassRole` (for CDK deployment)

## Quick Setup

Once you have the credentials, run:
```bash
aws configure
```

Then enter:
- AWS Access Key ID: `your_access_key_here`
- AWS Secret Access Key: `your_secret_key_here`
- Default region: `us-west-2` (or your preferred region)
- Default output format: `json`

## Alternative: Environment Variables

You can also set them as environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

Once you have these credentials configured, I can immediately:
1. Deploy your CDK stack
2. Run the comprehensive test
3. Verify the CloudWatch alarm behavior
4. Test the EventBridge integration

Would you like me to wait while you set up the credentials, or do you have them ready?
